# notes from meeting with milisa:

1. For alleni, we can concentrate the antibodies 2:1. if so:
	- change buffer from PBS to water. 
	- keep in a fridge. it can last months.
2. given the nanodrop is close to the ratio, we should just keep using the weight.
3.we can make a stock a venoms instead, and take the nanodrop of that for higher precicion. keep in the freezer
